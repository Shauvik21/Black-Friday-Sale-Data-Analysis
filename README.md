# EDA-Using-Python
This is a data analyst portfolio project where I explore a Black Friday Sales dataset using python. Glimpses of important activities I did using python:

Generated descriptive statistical values for numerical columns. Also explored categorical columns. Got percentage distribution of each product id. Handled missing values. Fetched maximum purchase amount. Found purchase amount for a specific user and product id. Found the top 20 most revenue generated customer and their product id. Found which age group bought the most products. Found total selling amount generated via website. Tagged records to 'high focused' transactions where the amount has been more than 5000. Got the total purchase amount and average purchasing amount based on gender.
